# Common state üîÆ
A Flutter package that facilitates working with [flutter_bloc](https://github.com/felangel/bloc/tree/master/packages/flutter_bloc) package, Making it easier to deal with states and api Calls.
At its core the main goal of the package is being able to control the state automatically, emitting the correct state whether it's a success, failure or loading....



# Usage

###  The very first thing you have to do is defining your own types, in order to pass us your error type (OPTIONAL)
supposing your ErrorType is defined as CustomErrorType
```dart

typedef AppStates = States<CustomErrorType>; // this one is simply Map<String,CommonState<dynamic,CustomErrorType>>

typedef AppCommonState<T> = CommonState<T, CustomErrorType>;

typedef Success<T> = SuccessState<T, CustomErrorType>;
typedef Loading<T> = LoadingState<T, CustomErrorType>;
typedef Failure<T> = FailureState<T, CustomErrorType>;
typedef Empty<T> = EmptyState<T, CustomErrorType>;
typedef Initial<T> = InitialState<T, CustomErrorType>;

```
After applying this step you won't need to pass your error type as generic every time you are going to pass a new state, just use your predefined types.


# Example

### Supposing we have to fetch data from api, one paginated and one not, and post some other here is the steps we have to go through, 
This example will use BLoc as an option, feel free to use cubit, you will find the same methods waiting for you...

### 1. Define your state
Your state must inherit **StateObject** class, and must be used as the following:
```dart
class ExampleState extends StateObject<ExampleState> {
    static const String state1 = 'getData';
    static const String state2 = 'postData';
    static const String state3 = 'getPaginatedData';
     ExampleState([States? states])
      : super(
          [
            const Initial<String>(state1),
            const Initial<bool>(state2),
            PaginationState<String>(state3)
          ],
          (states) => ExampleState(states),
          states,
        );
}
```
Please take to notice the following things:
-  that **States** must be provided as a positioned Optional parameter in your object constructor.
-  Your states, will be added as a list to the super constructor, the state name is passed to each state
-  Pagination states will be added to the list and will be handled respectivly.
### 2. Define your Events
You will not find anything new in this step, it's just how it's usually done in the flutter_bloc package
```dart
abstract class ExampleEvent  {}

class Fetch extends ExampleEvent {
  const Fetch();
}

class Post extends ExampleEvent {
  const Post();
}

class FetchPaginated extends ExampleEvent {
    final int pageKey
  const FetchPaginated(this.pageKey);
}
```
### 3. Define your Bloc

Here you will find new methods in your bloc/cubit, that will act as your event handlers.
- **multiStateApiCall<Event,ReturnType,ErrorType>**: This methods Handles A **FutureResult** callback, for a **Bloc/Cubit** that has multiple instances of **CommonState**.
- **ApiCall<ReturnType,ErrorType>**: This method does exactly the same as the previous but for a **Cubit** with single **CommonState** as its State.
  <br>
  
- **multiStatePaginatedApiCall<Event,ReturnType>**: Same thing applies but for Paginated data, for a **Bloc/Cubit** that has multiple instances of **CommonState**.
- **PaginatedApiCall<Event,ReturnType>**: This method does exactly the same as the previous but for a **Cubit** with single **CommonState** as its State.
  

```dart
class MultiStateBloc extends Bloc<CommonStateEvent, MultiStateBlocState> {
  MultiStateBloc() : super(MultiStateBlocState()) {
    multiStateApiCall<Fetch, String>(ExampleState.state1, (event) => getSomeDataUseCase());

    multiStateApiCall<Post, bool>(ExampleState.state2, (event) => postSomeDataUseCase());

    // it takes your state name , your callback and the page key
    multiStatePaginatedApiCall<FetchPaginated,String>(ExampleState.state3, (event) => someUseCase(), (event) => event.pageKey);
}
```

### 4. Then you Can let Our builders Do the job for you in the screen.
The package Provides you with the following builders:
- **ResultBuilder** : Used for a cubit with a single **CommonState**. 
- **CommonStateBuilder** : Used for a **BLoc/Cubit** with multi **CommonState** instances
- **CommonStatePaginatedBuilder** : Used for a **BLoc/Cubit** with multi **CommonState** instances for Paginated data

Those are the package provided ones, feel free to override them in your App to Provide your error Types and add your custom behaviors



## Things to take into consideration
Make sure to utilize **PaginationModel<T>**  for as your pagination model.
If you have your pagination model nested inside another model, make sure to inherit from **PaginatedModel<T>** class and override the **getPaginatedDataMethod**, that will enable our handlers to handle your model respectively.
